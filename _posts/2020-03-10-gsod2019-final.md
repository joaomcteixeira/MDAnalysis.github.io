style="float: right" alt="GSoD with MDAnalysis" width="40%"/> The
inaugural [Google Season of Docs][gsod] 2019 has wrapped up. Google
sponsored a technical writer to work with an open source project to
work on their documentation. MDAnalysis was [one of the GSoD
projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2019-05-01-gsod2019 %}) with
technical writer @lilyminium.

She [successfully completed her project][gsod-participants] *A user
guide structured by topic*. She shared her thoughts in her blog post
[Project report: A user guide for MDAnalysis][project-report].

You can already see the pre-1.0 version of the new **[User Guide][]** on
our website; an expanded version of the User Guide will be released
together with the upcoming 1.0 release of MDAnalysis. As one seasoned
core developer said: "Amazing, reading this I can still learn new
things about MDAnalysis!".

Especially for **new users**, she created the new **[Quick Start
Guide][]**, which is now the recommended first tutorial when learning
MDAnalysis.

We are glad that @lilyminium will continue working with MDAnalysis as
our newest [MDAnalysis Core Developer][coredevs].
